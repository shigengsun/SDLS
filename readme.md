#This is an implementation of Armijo Back-tracking line search on Training DNN
Implemented by Shigeng Sun, Sept 2022
At this moment this code is undergoing heavy development and testing. 

#The implementation is heavily based on the original SGD implementation in Pytorch
## For the purpose of retaining the original code design and workflow for ease of deployment as an optimizer.
## Besides producing a probable step acceptance mechanism for training DNNs, 
## the focus is also to demonstrate one relatively simple way of incorperating line search into production of
large machine learning solvers, so as to 

*invite more researchers from ML and optimizaton alike to the theory and practice of optimization and machine learning.*
